In this practice section all of the following concepts have been covered in detai
Feel free to explore the rest of my github for applications instead of just
code snippets

Core Programming Concepts
Data Types

Primitive Types

Numbers (integers, floating-point, complex)
Strings (text and character data)
Booleans (true/false values)
Null/Nil/None (absence of value)

Complex Types

Arrays/Lists (ordered collections)
Dictionaries/Maps/Hashes (key-value pairs)
Sets (unique, unordered collections)
Custom Objects (user-defined types)

Variables and Memory Management

Variable declaration and assignment
Scope (global, local, block)
Memory allocation and garbage collection
References vs. values
Immutability vs. mutability

Functions and Methods

Purpose and benefits of functions
Function parameters and return values
Pure functions vs. side effects
First-class functions
Higher-order functions
Closures and scope
Method chaining
Function composition

Control Flow

Decision making (conditional statements)
Loops and iteration
Breaking and continuing
Error handling and exceptions
Program flow and execution order

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and objects
Inheritance and composition
Encapsulation
