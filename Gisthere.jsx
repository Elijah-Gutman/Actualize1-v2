I am now using this as a place to keep track of my IT thougths even if they have nothing specifically to do
with my OWN projects and web development. 

I learned how to use Jira the other day, I already used Jira...., its called gitHub projects. People really need to
relax when it comes to knowing specific types of softwares. Now Tableau on the other hand. That is super useful and to 
me something unique. The idea of representing my data so easily is a godsend and I look forward to playing with it
more down the line when we need to bring larger peieces of data to investors. I know how to look up SQL querries but
to never have to do it slowly like that for a job sounds pretty boss.... 

WE had a developer meeting tonight and disscussed next steps. Long story short we are fleshing out the final parts of 
landing page, we are creating the sign up and sign in features and populating them with user roles from the database. 
We are also fixing up the platform(Dashboard) that is seen by the users ONCE they sign in, we just need to flesh
out some requirements for the schema.
